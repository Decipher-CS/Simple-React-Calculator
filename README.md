# A simple Calculator build with React and ParticleJS


![](./readme_assets/react%20calc%20image.png)

### TODO
- [ ] Implement regex for operators
- [ ] Handle the misery somehow

### Links

- [Live site](https://silver-syrniki-c13140.netlify.app/)
- [GitLab remote repo](https://gitlab.com/Desipher/react-calculator)

### Why?

- The goal was to get more familiar with ReactJS.

### How?

- React for the HTML.
- Using REGEX to calculate the result.
- ParticleJS to for the background.
- SCSS for the calculator body decoration and rest.

### What's next?

- Need to learn some program methodology for better organizing the code. Not satisfied with the way it turned out in this project.
- Better debugging and testing techniques. ```Console.log``` is most definitely not the way forward.
